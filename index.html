						A great man once said, "In learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn.". Millions of people believe passionately  in the power of mentoring, we hope our app can be the platform that connects like-minde people and helping more to achieve their full potential.

					<h2>Our Story</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Mentorship app for Women Who Code</li>
						<li>Fast-track your career prospects</li>
						<li>Peer learning and coaching made simple</li>
						<li>Build an enduring professional network</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						We all know that getting the <em>right advice</em> at the <em>right time</em> and from the <em>right people</em> can dramatically change your life. <p />
						In today's world, it can be daunting for <strong>anyone</strong> to navigate the career jungle. This is <strong>especially</strong> true for <strong>women in technology</strong>. The tech world can be a bit of a boy's club. There are <strong>many</strong> women out there who are passionate about technology, who want to advanced their careers in technology, but who aren't sure where to start. These women need all the help they can get. <p />One organization that is dedicated to promoting women in technology is Women Who Code. We created MentorMe for Women Who Code. We had the following in mind. First, we would like to see more women fast-track their careers through mentorship. To make this happen, we designed our app to make finding and requesting coaching from anyone super simple and fun. Lastly, we hope MentorMe will enable more women to build enduring professional networks.<p />
						Now, Nidhi hear will tell you more about our project.

					<aside class="notes">
						We benchmarked many apps and two stood out the most. The first is Facebook Messenger, we really like its use of rounded profile image views. The second is an app from Google called One Today. It lets you discover non-profits every day and donate to projects you like. We love this app's fonts, layout, and user experience.

					<h2>Demo</h2>

						<small>
						<p />
						 Let's go through the flow of a new user. Piete here is an expert in {} and has graciously volunteered to become a mentor.
							<ol>
								<li>First, Pieter opens the MentorMe app and lands on the home screen. He clicks on Become a Mentor</li>
								<li>He is asked to login with facebook. And the end of it, he is taken to back to MentorMe, to the beginning of Edit Profile flow, where he can fill out more information about himself. The actionbar shows his progress. After he's done, he is taken to the Thank you page, where he can share the word via social media...Easy!</li>
							</ol>
						Now let's see how the app works for someone seeking mentorship. Nidhi here is an Android enthusiast who wants to know what it's like to be a professional Android developer. <p />

						UI features we may want to highlight (What sets us apart from other Mentoring apps?):
						<ul>
							<li>Women Who Code branding colors (action bar, fonts, pictures), Splash screen background is a slide show of images from Women Who Code meetups</li>
							<li>Mentor list view dims as we slide out the navigation drawer</li>
							<li>ListViewItems grow into view</li>
							<li>Flip animation when switching between list view and map view</li>
							<li>Action bar slides up and disappears to make room onscreen as we scroll down</li>
							<li>Edit profile shake animation to indicate missing required fields</li>
							<li>Edit profile action bar shows which step you're in.</li>
							<li>Request to connect sends a push notification to the target user</li>
							<li>Push notifications contain user's profile images</li>

					<h2>Next Steps</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>In-app messaging</li>
						<li>Meeting scheduler</li>
						<li>Log in with LinkedIn and GitHub</li>
						<li>Integration with Meetup</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now that you've seen what MentorMe can do today, let me tell you how we plan to make it even better. <p />
						First, we would like to add in-app messaging and a meeting scheduler, so that you can connect with a mentor using even fewer clicks <p />
						Next is more log in options with LinkedIn and GitHub.<p />
						Lastly, many Women Who Code events are announced on Meetup, so integration with Meetup would further enhance the experience.<p />
